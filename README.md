# OS-Lab-CS-314
 Lab 1: Minix Setup. Suggestion try to use the .ova file for setup. Request for remote access no need to waste time to install it yourself.

Lab 2: Understand the use of fork(), execvp(). Insert a single line for MINIX .

Lab 3: Easy lab prepare https://minixnitc.github.io/scheduling.html , http://www.minix3.org/docs/scheduling/report.pdf for viva.

Lab 4: Implementation of SJF and SRTF schedulers in C++.

Lab 5: Measuring time quanta allotted and order of execution for each process in a worklod mix (created by us), and then comparing it to after implementing a pseudo-FIFO scheduling. Minor changes in the source file.
        Important to distinguish between CPU bound and IO bound.

Lab 6: Applying Image Transformation in sequential manner and using concurrency as well - four methods have been used, which are atomic operations, semaphores, shared memory and pipes. We didn't score full marks in       this lab. Remember the time taken for execution of each is important. This lab takes time so start in advance. 

Lab 7: These are End Of Chapter Exercises of Three Easy Pieces you can easily find the solutions online.

Lab 8: Implementation of Page replacement algorithms.

Lab 9: MINIX creation, modification and deletion of files in the file system. Understand the difference between MFS and VFS read the pdfs provided in the Assignment9 and Understanding MINIX folder to answer VIVA questions.

Lab 10: immediate files in Minix. The source code is provided in the `minixnitc-website.pdf` file to understand immidiate files and algorithm of implementation.
